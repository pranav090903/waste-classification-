# waste-classification
This project focuses on classifying different types of waste using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to promote smart recycling and sustainability


Waste Classification – Week 1

This repository contains the preprocessed waste classification dataset for the CNN project on sustainability.

1) Dataset split into train and test folders.

2) Images are resized and ready for CNN model training.


Waste Classification –  Week 2
⚙️ Implementation Overview
During Week 2, the designed CNN model was implemented and trained using the Garbage Classification Dataset on Google Colab (with GPU acceleration).

🧩 Implementation Steps
Imported the Kaggle dataset using the Kaggle API.
Preprocessed images using ImageDataGenerator for scaling and augmentation.
Built and compiled a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras with:
Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers
Flatten and Dense layers
Dropout for overfitting control
Trained the model for multiple epochs and monitored accuracy/loss graphs.
Tested sample images and verified successful predictions.
